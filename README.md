# sdn-tool

This repository contains the code for a container-based SDN emulation tool that takes docker advantages to create virtual switches, controllers, and hosts that are customizable and portable as described in [PT+21]. The main goal is to provide a quick and easy setup platform to build scalable SDN emulation experiments. The emulation tool is built using golang language.
